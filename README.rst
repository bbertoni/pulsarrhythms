Detecting Rhythm in Pulsars
===========================

We'd like to characterize substructure in pulsar light curves. Because pulsars spin at very different frequencies, but their substructure is likely set by the physical properties of the emission region, which might not depend on the frequency of the pulsar. In order to solve this in a scale-independent way, we are going to use the Scale Transform, a specific case of the Mellin Transform. This is used in music analysis to detect and classify rhythm. 

Note: This is a very exploratory project with unclear outcome and part of AstroHackWeek 2016. Suggestions and comments welcome.
